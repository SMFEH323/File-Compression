# File-Compression
 
## Description
This project implements Huffman coding for file compression and decompression in Java. It includes classes for building Huffman trees, encoding and decoding data, and a main application interface for running compression operations.

## Files
- `CodingTree.java`: Implements the structure and operations of the Huffman Tree.
- `Huff.java`: Main class that handles the Huffman encoding and decoding processes.
- `HuffConstants.java`: Contains constants used across the project for Huffman operations.
- `HuffMain.java`: Entry point for running the Huffman coding operations.
- `WeightedCodingTree.java`: Extends `CodingTree` with weighting functionalities for nodes.
- `WeightedCodingTreeComparator.java`: Comparator for prioritizing tree nodes based on weight during the Huffman tree construction.

## Installation
To install this project, clone the repository using the following command:
```

```
Then, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

## Usage
To run Huffman encoding and decoding:
1. Compile the Java files using `javac HuffMain.java`.
2. Run the compiled class with:
